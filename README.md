Hi everyone my name is Vatsal and I am an avid NBA fan so I wanted to create an nba stats database.

This is a 2024-2025 regular season National Basketball Association stats database. 

When you click on the the website it gives you two options: click to see a secured greeting and achance to visit the login page directly.

You must login with the correct credentials to see the the database.

The login page displays the username and password so make sure to enter it as it is - it is case sensitive too.

When you get to the page locate player-controller subheading and click on it. 

This gives many options on how to get player data: you can get players who belong to a specific team, age, or by last name.

In addition if you wish to find players who averaged a spcific statistic: 23 points per game you can go to the get request get/api/players/ by-points to find those players. Click on the
try it out button on the top right corner to try the request out.

Furthermore, if you wish to find players who averaged between 5 and 8 assists per game you can go to the get request get/api/players/filter/assistsRange to find those players.

This page gives players by both specific statistics and by a range. You can do this with a lot of different statistics.

Also, you can use the put request to add in your custom player and delete any player you want using the delete request.

The Get/api/players request gives all the NBA players from last season in alphabetical order by their last names.

The test player subheading gives the count of the nba players in the database.

The mock player subheading gives you a chance to test a random player.

Thank you and have fun :)
